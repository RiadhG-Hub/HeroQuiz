Design Patterns
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):

Model: Represents the data and business logic (e.g., Quiz, Question).
View: SwiftUI views that represent the UI (e.g., QuizListView, QuestionView).
ViewModel: Manages the data for the view and handles user interactions (e.g., QuizListViewModel, QuestionViewModel).
Repository Pattern:

Abstracts data access, whether itâ€™s from a network, local database, or cache (e.g., QuizRepository). This makes it easier to manage data sources and swap them out if needed.
Dependency Injection:

Use dependency injection to inject services or repositories into view models. This can be achieved using property wrappers like @EnvironmentObject or initializer injection.
Coordinator Pattern (Optional):

If your app has complex navigation, consider using a Coordinator pattern to manage the navigation flow.
Combine:

Use Combine for reactive programming, handling asynchronous data streams in a declarative way.
Example Workflow
HomeView:

Displays a list of quizzes.
ViewModel: QuizListViewModel fetches data from QuizRepository.
QuizDetailView:

Displays details of a selected quiz.
ViewModel: QuizDetailViewModel manages the state of the selected quiz.
QuestionView:

Displays each question and collects responses.
ViewModel: QuestionViewModel manages the question state.
ResultView:

Displays the results after the quiz is completed.
ViewModel: ResultViewModel calculates and presents the results.
